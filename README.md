# INFO

🤖​ When sending a message to the bot, whatever the message is, it will be forwarded to the configured channel, administrators can assign permissions to forward messages to anyone by adding to users.json with the command **/add ID**.

# Why ✔️​

➡️​ I made it for a client, something basic but he didn't mind me publishing it, I know this is very used and I haven't seen a code like this (even if it's basic idk), you can sell permission to users to SPAM, Advertise in your channel among other things, you can also modify the source to make something more practical.

This script only uses **requests** and **datetime** as external module, so it is very light and fast, you can run it in a virtual machine.
